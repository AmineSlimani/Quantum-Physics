As a master's student in Computational Physics, I embarked on a journey to develop a program capable of accurately calculating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. During this endeavor, I serendipitously stumbled upon a novel formula that calculates Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of any state in a direct manner. In this study, I present the development and implementation of this newfound formula using Python programming language.
